## Singly Linked Lists

A `singly linked list`, in its simplest form, is a collection of `nodes` that collectively form a linear sequence. 
Each node stores a reference to an object that is an element of the sequence, as well as a reference to the next node of the list.

* First node - `head`
* Last node - `tail` (reference = None)
