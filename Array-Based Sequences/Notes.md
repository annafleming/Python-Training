## Low-Level Arrays
A group of related variables can be stored one after another in a contiguous portion of the computerâ€™s memory. 
We will denote such a representation as an _array_.
Each cell of an array must use the same number of bytes.

### Referential Arrays
Python represents a list or tuple instance using an internal storage mechanism of an array of object _references_.
