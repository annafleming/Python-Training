## Stacks
A `stack` is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed according 
to the `last-in, first-out (LIFO) principle`.
 Formally, a stack is an `abstract data type (ADT)` such that an instance `S` supports the following two methods:
* `S.push(e)`
* `S.pop()`
* `S.top()`
* `S.is_empty()`
* `len(S)`
